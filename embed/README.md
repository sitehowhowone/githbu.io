[forkphorus.github.io](https://forkphorus.github.io)

A JavaScript compiler for Scratch 2 and Scratch 3 projects. forkphorus is a *fork* of phos*phorus*.

## Scratch 3 Support

Unlike phosphorus, forkphorus supports compiling of Scratch 3 projects from a local `.sb3` and from the scratch.mit.edu website.

The Scratch 3 compiler is still in development and has very many bugs.
